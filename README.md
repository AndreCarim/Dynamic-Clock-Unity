# Clock for Unity SinglePlayer and Multiplayer

This is a simple clock example for Unity singleplayer and Multiplayer using Netcode. 
Simply copy the code and place into a new script, add this script to a gameobject and make another script to call the getTime() method which will return the string with the time format: 00:00 pm or am.

You can change the amount of minutes that a full day will take by changing the const HOW_LONG_IS_THE_DAY_IN_MINUTES.

Feel free to use as you like.
